# 8031A_HighVoltageCode

This is our robot's code for 2024 High Stakes it's made in C++ with pros and EZ template. We use Git and GitHub to control the version of our code. This helps us keep our code organized and makes it easy if we ever need to restore an old code version. This, lets us manage all of our code versions and backs up our code to the cloud just in case something happens to it. It is extremely, helpful and makes our coding process much faster and more convenient.


## Features

- Ring dectection with color sensor
- PID implimented to be accurate and percise
- Use of sensors including: Vision, Inertial, Rotation, and Distance


## FAQ

#### Are the programs cleanly written, well commented, and easy to follow?

Yes the code is very clean organised, I always make sure I comment almost evry line of code so me and my team knows what it does. It is pretty easy to follow it is seperated into a couple of files one for main, autons, globals, and helpers. These make our code well organised and easy to navigate.

#### Is the programing effective at solving game challenges for both Qualification Matches and Autonomous Coding Skills Challenge matches?

Yes the programming is pretty effective at both of the Qualification Matches and the Autonomous Coding Skills Challenge Matches. For Qualification Matches we determined what would get us the most points in the least amount of time and would get us the Autonomous win point. Our Autonomous scores a ring on the alliance wall stake, scores two rings on a mobile goal, and touches the center ladder. Giving us the solo win point so we get it every game. It works for all four corners of the field with little to no error.
